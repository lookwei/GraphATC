The accurate categorization of compounds within the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) system is fundamental for drug development and fundamental research. Although this area has garnered significant research focus for over a decade, the majority
of prior studies have concentrated solely on the Level 1 labels defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), neglecting the labels of the remaining four levels. This narrow focus fails to address the true nature of the task as a multilevel, multi-label classification challenge. Moreover, existing benchmarks like Chen-2012 and ATC-SMILES have become outdated, lacking the incorporation of new drugs or updated properties of existing ones that have emerged in recent years and have been integrated into the WHO ATC system. To tackle these shortcomings, we present a comprehensive approach, GraphATC.

**Our contributions**:
- We have constructed the most extensive ATC dataset to date.
- We implement the multilevel, multi-label study by extending the task to Level-2 (i.e. L2).
- We build more accurate representations for polymers.
- We optimize the representation learning for macromolecular drugs.
- We build a more effective framework for aggregating component representations of multicomponent drugs.
